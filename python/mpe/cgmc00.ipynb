    "Welcome the Chat GPT master class.  In this class you will learn what chat GPT is on a high-level, also, how it works, and how you can use it to build a business.  The live coding playground can be found [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JohnAPedagogy/playground/HEAD?urlpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJohnAPedagogy%2Fplayground%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fpython%2Fmpe%2Fcgmc00.ipynb).

    "### 1.1 What is Chat GPT?\n",
    "A program, when enhanced with artificial intelligence and capable of responding to a human being, by generating responses to text input from a computer in a conversational manner.  Such a program is known chat bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT is a special class of chat bots that have been trained on a very large body of text, typically above 50GB and and into the terabytes of data.  These type training models are known as large language models (LLMs).  The acronym GPT is translates as Generative Pre-trained Transformers and this gives an indication into the technology behind chat GPT.  Chat GPT uses a classic supervised training regime where the model uses the large body of text as examples of how to predict the next word based on the previous text.  In addition it uses a special class of neural networks known as Transformers to maintain semantic information across sequence lengths.  In summary the language model does not only tracks word sequences but also the logical meaning of the sentences and paragraphs it processes, so that when it generates it own text it is logically consistent with human understanding of the grammar used."

According to Andrew NG in the deeplearning.ai prompt engineering [course](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/), where a lot of the material in this master class is drawn from, chat GPT excels in the following areas:\n",

    "Hi there! In this class, we will learn about something called Chat GPT. It's like a robot that can talk to people using a computer! This robot has been trained to understand words and sentences in a special way so it can answer questions and even help with making computer programs. We will use it to help us build a new business. Isn't that cool? Let's get started!  This summary was generated by chat GPT when asked to rephrase the above sections for a 5 year old.  I hope it helped!"
